### Source station
Welcome to Spacelaxy’s open source central. Here we post our frameworks, libraries, open source projects, and also various other content we produce on social media or even in our official communities. You’re free
to contribute whenever you want and, if you’d like, join our programming community on Discord. Over there, we keep everything well organized around the projects so you can follow everything properly. But if not, we’ll stay right here anyway.

### Our mission
Spacelaxy was born as a startup focused on providing high quality and standard-driven services at reasonable costs, always aiming for solutions and innovations that are often outdated in the current market. We are always building something, even if it takes time, because excellence has its price. We are not a company that delivers buggy services just to fix them later. We create a lot of things focused on the developer audience, but we are not limited to it, and who knows, maybe in the future you’ll see even more cool stuff :) Originally founded in Brazil, Spacelaxy is now headquartered in Delaware, USA.
