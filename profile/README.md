### Source station
Welcome to Spacelaxy’s open source central. Here we post our frameworks, libraries, open source projects, and also various other content we produce on social media or even in our official communities. You’re free
to contribute whenever you want and, if you’d like, join our programming community on Discord. Over there, we keep everything well organized around the projects so you can follow everything properly. But if not, we’ll stay right here anyway.

### Our mission
Spacelaxy was born as a startup focused on providing high-quality, standard-driven services at reasonable costs, always aiming to bring solutions and innovations to a market that is often stuck with outdated practices. We're always building something, even if it takes time, because excellence comes at a price. We're not the kind of company that ships buggy services just to fix them later. We create a lot of things focused on the developer community, but we’re not limited to it, and who knows, maybe in the future you’ll see even more cool stuff :) Originally founded in Brazil, Spacelaxy is now headquartered in Lexington, Kentucky, USA.
